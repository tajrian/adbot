# adbot
This chatbot was made for the automation of Admission Help System. 
I developed this chatbot using two different approaches.
  1.Rule based approach:
    Here I used some predefined rules and sqlite3 as database to find the answers to admission test related questions.
  2.Used nltk and scikit learn where python-nltk methods were used to find the answers.
